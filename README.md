## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm YiZoo.

A Chinese programmer.

```python
class BriefIntroduction:
    position: str = "beijing",
    code_language: str = "python",
    technologies: dict = {
        "backend": ["Django", "DRF", "FastAPI"],
        "LLMDev": ["Langchain", "Langgraph", "MCP"],
        "tools": ["Celery", "Docker"],
